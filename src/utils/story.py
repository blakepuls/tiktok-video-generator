    #     - The narrative should have a strong, intimate quality, as if it was being told directly to the listener. Think along the lines of a short horror story from a Reddit post.
    #     - Avoid summaries or explanations at the end. If you'd like, you may end with a brief one-sentence reaction.
    #     - The title should be typed like a sentence

    #     Please format your response in JSON with the properties title, content, gender ('male' or 'female'), and description. This means that in your response you should escape the quotes and add a backslash before them. For example, if your title is "The time I... ", you should format it as \"The time I... \".
